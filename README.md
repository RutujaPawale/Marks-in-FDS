Problem statement:
Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data
Structure” by N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
a) The average score of class
b) Highest score and lowest score of class
c) Count of students who were absent for the test
d) Display mark with highest frequency

Objective :
The objective of this Python program is to efficiently manage and analyze the marks scored by students in the subject “Fundamental of Data Structure.” The program aims to:
1.	Store and organize the marks of N students in a structured manner.
2.	Compute and display the average score of the class to understand the overall performance.
3.	Identify and display the highest and lowest scores to highlight the range of marks.
4.	Count and report the number of students who were absent for the test, ensuring accurate record-keeping.
5.	Determine and display the mark with the highest frequency to identify common performance trends among students.

Outcome:
Data Collection: It prompts the user to enter the number of students and then records each student’s mark or an indication of absence (entered as 'A').
•	Compute Average Score: The program calculates the average score of the class by summing all the valid marks and dividing by the total number of students who were present.
•	Find Highest and Lowest Scores: It identifies the highest and lowest scores among the students who were present for the test, providing insights into the performance range of the class.
•	Count Absent Students: It counts how many students were absent by tallying the 'A' entries, helping in understanding attendance patterns.
•	Mark with Highest Frequency: Using the Counter from the collections module, the program determines which mark was most frequently recorded, highlighting the most common performance level.
